[TOC]



## Propellers:

* Pitch:

  * the theoretical forward travel of a propeller given one revolution. 
* Diameter:

  * the total outer circumference of the propeller measured across the center of the prop. 
  * The size of the circle that your props trace out as you rotate.
* Rake:

  * the angle measured in degrees from the perpendicular.
* Angle of Attack: [good explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7hyrD9-R4A)
  * we have the relative air flow (combination of the rotational speed of the propeller as well as the air velocity)
  * the angle between the propeller chord line as and the relative air flow
  * RPM increase, vertical speed increase and this will cause increase in angle of attack. 
  * increase in air speed causes decrease in angle of attack. 
* Aspect Ratio:
  * It is the ratio of the wing span divided by the average chord or width of the wings
